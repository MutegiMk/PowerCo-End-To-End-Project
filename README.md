  ## Introduction
  > In today's competitive market, understanding customer churn and its underlying factors is crucial for businesses. This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between price sensitivity and customer churn in a specific industry. By examining the historical data and performing exploratory analysis, I aim to uncover insights that can help businesses improve customer retention strategies
  
 ## Project Overview
  - Data collection: Gathering relevant data related to customer behavior, pricing, and churn.
  
  - Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
  - Exploratory data analysis: Conducting exploratory analysis to understand the patterns and relationships within the data.
  - Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
  - Model building: Developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on price sensitivity and other factors.
  - Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
  - Insights and recommendations: Summarizing the findings and providing
